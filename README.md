## 🧠 What is AlgorithmViz?

**AlgorithmViz** is a mobile application built with **Flutter** and **Rive** that visually demonstrates core computer science algorithms through interactive and dynamic animations.

> Whether you're a **student learning algorithms**, a **developer debugging logic**, or a **teacher explaining concepts**, AlgorithmViz makes abstract ideas **visual, fun, and intuitive**.
